  abstract =      {A new LDA-based face recognition system is presented in this paper. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the most popular linear projection techniques for feature extraction. The major drawback of applying LDA is that it may encounter the small sample size problem. In this paper, we propose a new LDA-based technique which can solve the small sample size problem. We also prove that the most expressive vectors derived in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix using principal component analysis (PCA) are equal to the optimal discriminant vectors derived in the original space using LDA. The experimental results show that the new LDA process improves the performance of a face recognition system signi"cantly. 2000 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract =      {We propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests at the certification step. A large dataset (when compared to other studies in this domain) is considered, with white and red vinho verde samples (from Portugal). Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming the multiple regression and neural network methods. Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. Furthermore, similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets},

  abstract =      {Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the wellknown methods for supervised dimensionality reduction. Over the years, many LDA-based algorithms have been developed to cope with the curse of dimensionality. In essence, most of these algorithms employ various techniques to deal with the singularity problem, which occurs when the data dimensionality is larger than the sample size. They have been applied successfully in various applications. However, there is a lack of a systematic study of the commonalities and differences of these algorithms, as well as their intrinsic relationships. In this paper, a unified framework for generalized LDA is proposed via a transfer function. The proposed framework elucidates the properties of various algorithms and their relationships. Based on the presented analysis, we propose an efficient model selection algorithm for LDA.

The generalized MSE solution is shown to be equivalent to applying a certain classification rule in the space defined by LDA. The relationship between the MSE solution and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is extended to multi-class problems and also to undersampled problems for which the classical LDA is not applicable due to singularity of the scatter matrices. In addition, an efficient algorithm for LDA is proposed exploiting its relationship with the MSE procedure. Extensive experiments verify the theoretical results. Keywords.

  abstract =      {We analyze critically the use of classi cation accuracy to compare classi ers on natural data sets, providing a thorough investigation using ROC analysis, standard machine learning algorithms, and standard benchmark data sets. The results raise serious concerns about the use of accuracy for comparing classi ers and draw into question the conclusions that can be drawn from such studies. In the course of the presentation, we describe and demonstrate what we believe to be the proper use of ROC analysis for comparative studies in machine learning research. We argue that this methodology is preferable both for making practical choices and for drawing scienti c conclusions.},

  abstract =      {In this paper, we propose a novel geometric method for the alignment of two overlapping range images. The method first employs the traditional ICP criterion to establish a set of possible correspondences and then refine these correspondences using geometric constraints derived from properties of reflected correspondence vectors. In this way, the method overcomes a major limitation of the traditional ICP criterion which is the introduction of false matches in almost every iteration of the alignment. For an accurate estimation of the geometric parameters of interest, the Monte Carlo method is used in conjunction with a median filter. Finally, the quaternion method is used to estimate the motion parameters based on the refined correspondences. Experimental results based on both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method can effectively align two overlapping range images with a small motion. 1. INTRODUCTION With recent technological developments in optics and electronics, range image acquisition systems are becoming more affordable and accurate. Since range images provide depth information, their analysis has proved simpler than that of the model based or projective images, leading to greater potential for applications in a number of tasks such as computer aided geometric design (CAGD), motion analysis, object recognition [5], and reverse engineering [3]. However, the alignment of two overlapping range images is still a fundamental problem in range image analysis. As a result, a large number of techniques have been proposed to deal with this limitation, such as techniques based on iterative closest point algorithm (ICP) [1, 10], interactive method [8], and triangle matching [7], among many others. The ICP method is the most promising of the image registration methods. Its concept is simple and relatively easy to implement. However, the problem of the ICP algorithm is that the criterion used to establish correspondences often unavoidably introduces false matches in almost every iteration of the alignment since it just uses the distance constraint to determine the position of the correspondents in two range images, when it is known that a position in 3D space can only be uniquely determined by three constraints. Advances have been made through a number of proposed techniques to improve the ICP method such as spin images [5], bitangent curves [9], and normal and tangent information [4]. A careful analysis reveals that these methods either employ invariants described in a single coordinate to reduce false matches, or use thresholds or perform the general 2 test to reject false matches. The problem still remains because invariants cannot theoretically completely eliminate false matches, thresholds are context dependent and often are not easily determined, and the 2 test depends on the estimation of the uncertainty of every point. In this paper, we propose a novel geometric method for the alignment of two overlapping range images representing a significant improvement to the traditional ICP method. This novel method first employs the ICP criterion [1] to establish a set of possible correspondences between the two range images to be aligned. Since false matches are created by the motion, we argue that their elimination can only be carried out using the properties of the motion. In [6], we extended Chasles' screw motion theory by analysing the geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors synthesised into a single coordinate frame. Such analysis has provided an exact insight into the physical interpretation of rigid motion constraints bridging the points described in different coordinate frames before and after a motion. Thus, the novel method then employs the geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors to evaluate whether possible correspondences are plausible or not yielding a set of refined correspondences. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the geometric parameter estimation, the Monte Carlo method in conjunction with a median filter are employed. Finally, this novel method employs the quaternion method [1] to estimate the motion parameters based on the refined correspondences. The proposed alignment model has been validated through experiments based on both synthetic data and real images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm is accurate and robust for the alignment of two overlapping range images with a small motion. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2},

  abstract =      {The max-sum classifier predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximizing a sum of quality functions defined over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables. Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the max-sum classifier. Learning parameters of the max-sum classifier is a challenging problem because even computing the response of such classifier is NP-complete in general. Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classifiers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classifiers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classifier. Besides the max-sum classifiers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulfill some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classifiers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classifiers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classifiers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classifiers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classifier. Keywords: max-xum classifier, hidden Markov networks, support vector machines},

  abstract =      {A generalized discriminant analysis based on a new optimization criterion is presented. The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) when the scatter matrices are singular. An efficient algorithm for the new optimization problem is presented. The solutions to the proposed criterion form a family of algorithms for generalized LDA, which can be characterized in a closed form. We study two specific algorithms, namely Uncorrelated LDA (ULDA) and Orthogonal LDA (OLDA). ULDA was previously proposed for feature extraction and dimension reduction, whereas OLDA is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. The features in the reduced space of ULDA are uncorrelated, while the discriminant vectors of OLDA are orthogonal to each other. We have conducted a comparative study on a variety of real-world data sets to evaluate ULDA and OLDA in terms of classification accuracy. Keywords: dimension reduction, linear discriminant analysis, uncorrelated LDA, orthogonal LDA, singular value decomposition},
